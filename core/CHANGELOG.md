Changelog
=========

 with a default sequence provider.
 *
- v0.0.5 (27/02/21) - can specify 'image' property in pano JSON for sequences,
 allowing use of arbitrary images (filename does not need to match image ID)
 
- v0.0.4 (26/02/21) - sequence loading behavior changed, as described above.

- v0.0.3 (22/02/21) : add 'panoTransFunc' option to allow specification of * a panorama transition function (to allow transition effects, such as Eesger's transitions).
